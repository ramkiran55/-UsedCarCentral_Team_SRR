# UsedCarCentral_Team_SRR
Using the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data, we aim to build a web application that allows users to post or edit existing used car listings (sellers), as well as browse, add to favorites or cart, and buy used cars (buyers). Users can register as either a seller or a buyer on the platform.

### Project Description:
Using the Kaggle dataset, we aim to build a web application that allows users to post or edit their existing used car listings (sellers), as well as browse, add to favorites or cart, and buy used cars (buyers). Users can register as either a seller or a buyer on the platform.
#### Objectives:
Our objectives for this project are to:
1.	Create a user-friendly web application for buying and selling used cars.
2.	Allow users to easily search for and find the car they are looking for based on their preferences (SELECT statements).
3.	Provide sellers with a platform to easily list and manage their used car listings (Insert, delete and Update statements).
4.	Create a safe and secure platform for transactions between buyers and sellers.
##### Future Scope: Allow buyers to communicate with sellers, through the platform to ask questions or negotiate deals.
#### Usefulness:
Our database will be useful for people who are looking to buy or sell used cars. With our platform, buyers can easily find the car they are looking for based on their preferences and browse through listings to find the best deal. Sellers can easily list their used cars and manage their listings on our platform. Our interactive interface will make the process of buying and selling used cars easier and more efficient.
There are several similar platforms that exist for buying and selling used cars, such as Craigslist, Autotrader, and CarGurus. However, our platform aims to provide a more user-friendly experience with additional features like favorites and cart, and a safe and secure platform for transactions.
#### Dataset:
The Kaggle dataset we will be using contains approximately 550,000 records of used car listings from various online portals. The dataset contains 26 columns including car make, model, year, condition, odometer reading, price, and location. We will use this data to create a database for our web application and normalize the data and split it into tables as needed. We may also supplement this data with additional information from other sources to provide more comprehensive listings.
The dataset was collected by Austin Reese and published on Kaggle in 2019. The purpose of the dataset is to provide a comprehensive collection of used car listings for research and analysis...
